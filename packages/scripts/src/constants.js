    <p>
      You are receiving this email because you have registered on British Columbia's Emergency
      <br />
      Health Provider Registry (EHPR). Thank you very much for your willingness and interest in
      <br />
      supporting BC's health system.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Since its launch, the program has adapted to respond to an increase in demand as a result of
      <br />
      climate change (e.g., wildfires, floods), as well as a global pandemic. More than 10,000 
      <br/> 
      people are currently registered with the EHPR and the Ministry of Health is undertaking a 
      <br/>
      refresh of the system to update registrant information and improve our capacity to contact
      <br/>
      and deploy registrants in a timely way.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>
        <i>
        If you are still interested in being an active registrant with the EHPR and want to be 
        <br/>
        considered for current and future emergency deployments,
         <a href="https://ehpr.gov.bc.ca/submission/1">
          please click this link to register
          <br/>
          with the new system.
        </a> If you do not complete the new form, you will be removed from the
        <br/>
        EHPR and will no longer be considered when opportunities arise.
        </b>
      </p>At this time, health authorities are interested in contacting registrants to support the <br/>
       following service areas:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hospital settings including: critical care, intensive care, emergency departments and support staff</li>
      <li>Long-term care and/or Assisted living</li>
      <li>Long-term care</li>
      <li>Home support</li>
      <li>COVID-19 specific support (such as immunization and testing)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Supports may be available to registrants willing to deploy and there may be opportunities for
    <br/>
    recently retired registrants (those with Temporary Emergency Registration).If you chose to
    <br/>
    re-affirm your registration, thank you for your continued interest in the EHRP. If you do not, 
    <br/>
    thank you for your initial registration. We could not do this work without the commitment and 
    <br/>
    support of dedicated professionals like yourself. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you have any questions, please email EHPRQuestions@gov.bc.ca.    
    </p>
    <br />
    Sincerely,
    <br />
    <br />
    Mark Armitage, Assistant Deputy
    <br />
    Minister Health Sector Workforce and Beneficiary Services Division
